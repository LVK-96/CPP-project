The program uses the SFML -graphics library. To install SFML on Ubuntu, follow the official SFML guide. SFML 2.3 should be installed by default on Aalto Linux machines. Because the Aalto machines have version 2.3, we decided to use version 2.3 aswell. If you are running a newer version of SFML, the compiler might produce some warnings, but the program should still compile. 

To compile the program use the provided makefile. To use the makefile, open a terminal and navigate to tile-matching-2/src, and type “make run main”. To clear output files, you can type “make clean”.
